# Common-Spatial-Pattern-Algorithm
Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a mathematical procedure used in signal processing for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents which have maximum differences in variance between two windows. This algorithm is mainly used in motor imagery based BCI for processing EEG data.
